## Season 03 Started! And Halted&hellip;
[Season 03]({% link _seasons/season03.md %}) Launched the beginning of 2022, a return to more vanilla-adjacent Minecraft. Due to a lot of life stuff documenting the season lagged, and nearly dying from leukemia put the season on a sudden halt. I'm [doing good all things considered](https://www.anonjr.com/2025/12/Alive-and-Well-Mostly.html) now.

I've set up a Season 03 Page, and populated it as best I can for now. I'll try to fill in the missing bits when I'm able.

Because life is still a little &hellip; chaotic &hellip; CoffeeCraft is going on an indefinite hiatus. Depending on how things go in the future we may start things back up for Season 04. I wish I had more to write, and maybe I'll come back and at least elaborate a little more, but most of what needs to be said is either on the [Season 03 page]({% link _seasons/season03.md %}) or the [personal update](https://www.anonjr.com/2025/12/Alive-and-Well-Mostly.html) I wrote on my website.

The livestreams (at least for me) are still available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@anonjr) and [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/@anonjr).
