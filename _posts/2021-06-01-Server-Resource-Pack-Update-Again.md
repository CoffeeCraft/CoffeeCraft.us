## Updated Resource Pack
I made a couple small changes to the resource pack we use on the server today. Most of the resources are still from VanillaTweaks, and can be had via the links on the [Season 01 page]({% link _seasons/season01.md %}).

What's new is a change to the Totem of Undying. It's a small change that I've talked about, and finally got around to. I'll let you check out the live stream to see if you spot it. 🙃

I also added my second ever resource pack - some custom Wandering Trader voices! After making a resource pack that replaced the Villager voices, and having a lot more fun with it than I expected, I put this together for the Wandering Trader. It's still a little "Version 1"-ish. I never really worked on voices before, so getting something that is both different and usable is still a bit of a struggle.

The pack replaces all the wandering trader vocalizations with some actual audio work, voiced by me, and altered so it's not me listening to me every time a wandering trader spawns in the middle of my redstone. You can hear some examples and get a quick run-down in the video below:
