## The Interrupted Season
Season 03 started normal enough Jan 2022, even if AnonJr forgot to put this season page together at the start&hellip; It was a return to vanilla-adjacent Minecraft. For a performance boost we started using [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) on the server, and we used a similar selection of datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resources from [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/). There were a few additional textures, both self-created and imported from elsewhere. More information and the full server pack is at the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CoffeeCraft/CoffeeCraft-Texture-Pack/releases/). I'd love to give a link to the various resources we used from Vanilla Tweaks throughout the season, but sadly documentation this season kinda fell by the wayside.

If I remember right, this was the selection of datapacks from VooDooBeard:

 * [Beehive Lore](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#beehive_lore)
 * [Climbable Chains](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#climbable_chains)
 * [Trader Notifications](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#trader_notify)

Some of us were also running [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home), and a few custom additional textures.

Sadly this go-round the seed didn't get documented at the start of the season, and we've since dropped the server. I should have a backup *somewhere* that I can use to get the seed info and maybe a list of the final datapacks to update this page.

The server started out on Minecraft 1.18.1, and at the point of interruption was updated to 1.19.4. Near the end of 2021 we switched from CubedHost to [Nodecraft](https://nodecraft.com/) as CubedHost unfortunately closed. I had a very good experience with Nodecraft, and would use them again. I ended up cancelling services when CoffeeCraft ended up in an interminable hiatus.

Everything went on hold in August 2022 when I (AnonJr) nearly died of leukemia. I'm [doing good all things considered](https://www.anonjr.com/2025/12/Alive-and-Well-Mostly.html) now. At the time of writing (Dec 2025) Season 03 is just going to be left unceremoniously unfinished. CoffeeCraft as a project is getting shelved for the time being.
